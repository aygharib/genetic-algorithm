# genetic-algorithm
graphically reconstructs any `*.ppm` image
- uses an exponentially decaying adaptive learning rate to reduce iterations needed to generate an accurate result

## design decisions/features
- no 3rd party libraries used. the focus on this project is to explore crossover genetic algorithms without abstracting this logic away to pre-built libraries

## examples of graphical reconstruction

## changes in the future
- add unit and e2e testing
- display benchmarks to the user
